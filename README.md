**Quota Sentinel** is an ultra-secure, local-first extension designed to monitor your LLM token usage and parallel agent load in real-time. It provides a sleek, "Fortress Mode" sidebar that ensures your data never leaves your machine.

## 🛡️ Key Features

*   **Zero-Exfiltration Promise**: No external backend. No tracking. All logs are parsed locally from `.gemini/logs`.
*   **Dual-Surface HUD**: Automatically appears in both your Editor Sidebar and Agent Manager view.
*   **Shared Bucket Visualization**: Concentric radial gauges visually represent shared quotas between models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet & Haiku).
*   **Live Pulse Alerts**: The UI "pulses" when your quota drops below 15% (Warning) or 5% (Critical).
*   **Parallel Load Meter**: Track how many Antigravity agents are running in parallel.
*   **Guanajuato Timezone Sync**: Automatic reset tracking aligned with standard CST resets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install**: Search for "Quota Sentinel" in the extensions view.
2.  **Onboard**: Complete the "Fortress" security check on first launch.
3.  **Monitor**: Keep the sidebar open to watch your token burn in real-time.
